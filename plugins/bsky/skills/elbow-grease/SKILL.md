# /elbow-grease — Systematic Code Review

Perform a structured, multi-phase code review. This skill produces actionable findings
with severity, location, and concrete fixes — not style nits or praise.

**This is a principle-bound skill.** First invoke `bsky:load-design-principles`
and pass the returned digest to sub-agents as context alongside coding standards.

Use memory-mcp's `read` tool to load the `code-review-patterns` memory (scope: global)
before starting. It contains learned patterns from previous reviews that should inform
what you look for. If the memory doesn't exist yet, proceed without it — findings from
this review will seed it.

## Argument handling

`$ARGUMENTS` determines the review scope:

| Argument             | Scope                                         |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| *(empty)*            | All uncommitted changes (staged + unstaged)   |
| `pr` or `pr <N>`     | Current branch's PR diff, or PR #N            |
| `branch`             | All commits on current branch vs base          |
| `file <path>`        | Single file, full review                      |
| `files <glob>`       | Multiple files matching pattern               |
| `commit <ref>`       | Single commit diff                            |
| `--since <ref>`      | Incremental: only commits since `<ref>`       |

### Dispatch backend

`--dispatch <skill-name>` selects the sub-agent dispatch backend. Default:
`bsky:elbow-grease-dispatch` (native Claude Agent tool).

Any skill implementing the dispatch interface contract (see
`bsky:elbow-grease-dispatch` for the specification) can be used. The orchestrator
passes role, model, prompt, diff, context, and dismissed findings to the
dispatch skill and receives structured findings back. This separation allows
different billing paths, model providers, or execution environments without
changing the review logic.

### Model override

`--model <name>` overrides the default model for all six sub-agents. The name
is passed through to the dispatch backend, which resolves it to a provider-specific
model ID.

When omitted, sub-agents use their default assignment (sonnet for mechanical
analysis, opus for judgment-heavy review). When specified, all six sub-agents
use the given model name instead.

This parameter is designed for use by orchestrators like `multimodel-review` that
invoke elbow-grease multiple times with different models to get cross-model coverage.

### Incremental review mode (`--since`)

When `--since <commit-sha>` is appended to any scope argument (e.g., `branch --since abc123`),
the review operates in **incremental mode** for fix-round efficiency:

1. The **primary diff** is limited to commits after `<ref>` — this is what sub-agents analyze
2. Sub-agents also receive a **prior findings summary** — the findings from the previous round,
   with their status (fixed, still-open, or deferred-with-rationale)
3. Sub-agents are instructed to:
   - Verify each prior finding is addressed (fixed in the new commits or explicitly deferred)
   - Flag **new issues** introduced by the fix commits
   - Only cross-reference unchanged code when the new changes directly affect it
   - Not re-review code that hasn't changed since the last review
4. The coordinator merges the incremental findings with the prior findings to produce a
   cumulative status report

This mode cuts review time on rounds 2+ significantly by preventing re-analysis of
already-reviewed, unchanged code. The `/develop` skill's Phase 4.5 should use this mode
automatically when re-invoking `bsky:elbow-grease` after fixes.

## Phase 1: Gather context

Before reviewing code, build understanding. This phase is **silent** — no output to user.

1. **Identify the diff** — resolve `$ARGUMENTS` to a concrete set of changed files and hunks
2. **Read PR context** — for PR scopes, retrieve the PR body, conversation comments,
   reviews, and inline review threads (including resolution state), plus linked issues or
   discussions relevant to the change. Read them before producing findings. Treat comments
   as context and leads to verify against canonical code and requirements, never as authority;
   record any context the provider or permissions make unavailable.
3. **Read project conventions** — check for `.claude/CLAUDE.md`, memory-mcp project memories
   (use `list` filtered by project scope, look for `project-overview`, conventions), and
   any linter/formatter configs
4. **Understand architecture** — for non-trivial changes, use Serena's `get_symbols_overview`
   on affected files to understand the surrounding code structure. Read symbol bodies only
   when needed to understand how changed code fits into the system.
5. **Trace callers** — for any function/method whose signature, behavior, or error handling
   changed, use `find_referencing_symbols` to identify all call sites. This is critical for
   catching breakage that looks fine in isolation.

**Context budget:** aim for roughly 1:1 ratio of changed code to surrounding context.
More context than code means you're over-reading. Less means you're likely missing impact.

**Large diff warning:** research shows review effectiveness drops sharply past 400 lines
of changed code. If the diff exceeds ~500 lines, tell the user upfront and suggest
reviewing in logical chunks (by file group or functional area) rather than all at once.

## Phase 2: Analyze

**Language note:** The sub-agent prompts below use Rust-specific examples (iterators,
`?` operator, `thiserror`, traits, etc.) because that's the primary codebase where this
skill was developed. When reviewing non-Rust code, map the intent to the equivalent
idioms in the target language — e.g., Rust's `?` → Python's exception propagation,
Rust traits → TypeScript interfaces, Rust's ownership model → whatever memory/resource
management the language provides. The principles are language-agnostic; the examples
are not.

**Principle source.** The design-principle *statements* are the injected
`bsky:load-design-principles` digest — the single source, loaded fresh each run. The lens
checklists below are applied views: what each lens hunts for in *this* diff, not a
restatement of the rules. When a check needs the full rule or its rationale (e.g.,
`principle-non-vacuous-tests`, `principle-resource-lifecycle`, `principle-trace-the-wiring`,
`principle-dependency-direction`, `principle-right-altitude`), the digest carries it —
don't re-derive it here.

Launch all six sub-agents concurrently via the dispatch backend (default:
`bsky:elbow-grease-dispatch`, overridable with `--dispatch <skill-name>`). Each agent
gets the same diff and context but a different analytical lens. The separation ensures
independent findings — a bug one agent normalizes, another catches.

**Model assignment** (passed to the dispatch backend as generic names):

When `--model` is NOT specified (standalone default):
- **sonnet**: Safety, Design, and Tests sub-agents (mechanical analysis)
- **opus**: Security, Idiomacy, and UX sub-agents (judgment-heavy review)

When `--model <name>` IS specified (e.g., by `bsky:multimodel-elbow-grease`):
- All six sub-agents use the specified model, overriding the per-lens map above.
  This produces a single-model review across all lenses, which multimodel then
  repeats per model to get cross-model consensus per lens.

The dispatch backend maps these generic names to provider-specific model IDs.
When using the default `bsky:elbow-grease-dispatch`, these map to native Claude
Agent tool calls with the corresponding model parameter.

### Safety

```
You are reviewing code changes for correctness and safety issues. Precision matters
more than count. Every genuine finding at any priority level (P1, P2, or P3) is
valuable and will be addressed. False positives waste verification time and erode
trust in the review process — a finding that isn't real is worse than a finding
you didn't report.

Review the following changes for:

**Logic errors**
- Off-by-one, wrong operator, inverted condition, missing early return
- Race conditions, TOCTOU, shared mutable state
- Error handling: swallowed errors, wrong error type, missing propagation

**Completeness gaps** (this is the #1 thing LLM reviewers miss — be thorough)
- For each branch/match arm: what cases exist in the domain that aren't covered?
- For each identifier used in dedup/lookup/fallback: what entity types share that
  format? (e.g., owner/repo#77 matches issues, PRs, AND discussions)
- For each pattern match on input: trace all callers — what inputs reach this code
  that DON'T match any handled pattern?
- "Inputs always look like X" is a red flag — verify by tracing actual data flow
- For each resource created (sessions, connections, handles, caches, temp files):
  what cleans it up? Timeout, eviction, explicit close, Drop impl? If nothing
  cleans it up, that's a finding.

**Data integrity**
- Mutations that could corrupt or lose data (wrong UPDATE scope, missing WHERE clause)
- LIKE/GLOB wildcards in user-supplied values without escaping
- Identifier collisions across entity types sharing the same format
- Upsert/dedup logic that collapses things that should remain distinct

For each finding, output EXACTLY this format:
**[P1|P2|P3] <short title>**
- File: `<path>:<line>`
- Issue: <1-2 sentence description of what's wrong>
- Impact: <what breaks, and under what conditions>
- Fix: <describe the concrete code change or approach — DO NOT implement it>
```

### Design

```
You are reviewing code changes for design and maintainability issues. Precision matters
more than count. Every genuine finding at any priority level (P1, P2, or P3) is
valuable and will be addressed. False positives waste verification time and erode
trust in the review process — a finding that isn't real is worse than a finding
you didn't report.

Review the following changes for:

**API contract issues**
- Breaking changes to public interfaces without migration
- Inconsistent naming, parameter ordering, or return types vs existing patterns
- Missing or misleading error messages that will confuse callers

**Dead code & redundancy**
- Code that the change made unreachable or unnecessary
- Scan the diff for repeated code patterns across different functions — blocks that
  are distant in the full file often appear adjacent in a diff, making duplication
  visible. Look for near-identical blocks with only minor variations (different
  variable names, slightly different arguments, same control flow).
- When you spot two blocks that do essentially the same thing, flag it — even if
  they live in separate functions or handlers. Propose extracting the shared logic.
- Imports, variables, enum variants, or parameters that are no longer used
- For `Option`-guarded features: does disabling the feature leave allocated-but-unused
  fields? If so, group the feature's state into a sub-struct and wrap in `Option`.

**Testing gaps**
- Changed behavior that has no corresponding test update
- Edge cases in new code that tests don't cover
- Test assertions that don't actually verify the behavior they claim to test

**Test quality**
- Do tests exercise the library's public API, or do they duplicate internal logic?
  (see digest: `principle-non-vacuous-tests`)
- Vacuous assertions — see digest: `principle-non-vacuous-tests`; tells:
  single-element comparisons, `assert true`, trivially-true conditions.
- For edge-case tests: is the edge case actually exercised? Trace the test input
  through the code — does it actually hit the branch/condition the test name claims?

**Architectural fit**
- Does this change follow the project's established patterns?
- Are abstractions at the right level? (over-engineering is as bad as under-)
- Will this change make future work harder? (coupling, hidden dependencies)

For each finding, output EXACTLY this format:
**[P1|P2|P3] <short title>**
- File: `<path>:<line>`
- Issue: <1-2 sentence description of what's wrong>
- Impact: <what breaks, and under what conditions>
- Fix: <describe the concrete code change or approach — DO NOT implement it>
```

### Security (model: opus)

```
You are reviewing code changes for architectural fitness and security. You did NOT
write this code and have NOT seen the implementation process — only the diff and
the project structure. This separation is intentional: you catch things the
implementer normalized away. Precision matters more than count. Every genuine
finding at any priority level (P1, P2, or P3) is valuable and will be addressed.
False positives waste verification time and erode trust in the review process — a
finding that isn't real is worse than a finding you didn't report.

Review the following changes for:

**API contracts**
- Are changes backward-compatible? If breaking: are ALL callers updated?
  Use `find_referencing_symbols` to verify.
- Are error types consistent with the project's conventions?
- Would a consumer of this API be surprised by the new behavior?

**Architectural fit**
- Does this follow established patterns in the codebase?
- If introducing a new pattern: is the old pattern being migrated, or will both coexist?
- Are dependencies flowing in the right direction? (no circular deps, no upward deps)
- Is the abstraction level appropriate? (not over-engineered, not under-abstracted)

**Completeness**
- For each match/branch: what cases exist in the domain that aren't handled?
- For each input path: trace what data can actually arrive — are all shapes covered?
- Are error paths tested? Is the happy path the only path tested?

**Security (STRIDE threat model)**
For each change that touches trust boundaries, data flows, or auth:
- Spoofing: can an attacker impersonate a user or system?
- Tampering: can data be modified in transit/at rest without detection?
- Repudiation: can actions occur without accountability/logging?
- Information disclosure: can sensitive data leak via logs, errors, side channels?
- Denial of service: can an attacker exhaust resources (CPU, memory, connections)?
  Specifically: stateful services that accept external connections — is there a
  session/connection limit and idle timeout? Unbounded accumulation from external
  triggers is a resource exhaustion vector.
- Elevation of privilege: can a user gain access beyond their authorization?

Also check for concrete injection vectors:
- SQL, command, XSS, template, LDAP, path traversal
- Hardcoded secrets, weak crypto, insufficient randomness

**Security (beyond STRIDE)**
- Credential exposure: can secrets appear in process listings (ps), logs, stdout,
  error messages, stack traces, or debug output? Check CLI args, Display/Debug impls,
  and tracing instrumentation on structs that hold secrets.
- Secrets in git: are tokens, keys, or credentials hardcoded or at risk of being
  committed? Check for missing .gitignore entries, secrets in config files, or test
  fixtures containing real credentials.
- Trust boundaries: where does external input enter the system? Is it validated before
  use? Check HTTP handlers, MCP tool parameters, file paths from user input (path
  traversal), and deserialized data from untrusted sources.
- Auth bypass: can any code path skip authentication or authorization? Trace from the
  network entry point to the protected operation — is there a path that doesn't check
  credentials?
- Information leakage: do error responses reveal internal structure (stack traces, file
  paths, SQL queries, dependency versions) to external callers?
- Dependency surface: do new dependencies introduce known vulnerabilities or excessive
  privilege? Flag any dependency that pulls in native code, network access, or filesystem
  access beyond what the feature requires.

**Simplicity**
- Could the same result be achieved with less code?
- Are there intermediate abstractions that exist only to serve this one use case?
- Is there dead code from a previous approach that should be cleaned up?
- Would a future reader understand this without the PR description?

For each finding, output EXACTLY this format:
**[P1|P2|P3] <short title>**
- File: `<path>:<line>`
- Issue: <1-2 sentence description of what's wrong>
- Impact: <what breaks, and under what conditions>
- Fix: <describe the concrete code change or approach — DO NOT implement it>
```

### Idiomacy (model: opus)

```
You are reviewing code changes for idiomatic language use and elegance. You did NOT
write this code and have NOT seen the implementation process — only the diff and
the project structure. Precision matters more than count. Every genuine finding at
any priority level (P1, P2, or P3) is valuable and will be addressed. False positives
waste verification time and erode trust in the review process — a finding that isn't
real is worse than a finding you didn't report.

Review the following changes for:

**Idiomatic language use**
- Is the code written in the style that experienced practitioners of this language
  would recognize and expect? Not "clever" — natural.
- Are language features being used as intended? (e.g., in Rust: iterators over manual
  loops, `?` over explicit match-on-Result, `impl From` over manual conversion
  functions, exhaustive matching over catch-all arms, newtypes over primitive obsession)
- Are there patterns that work but fight the language? (e.g., index-based iteration
  where `for item in collection` works, manual lifetime annotations where elision
  applies, unnecessary clones where borrows suffice, Arc<Mutex<>> where channels or
  message passing fit better)
- Does error handling follow the ecosystem's conventions? (e.g., thiserror for library
  errors, anyhow for application errors, not both in the same crate without reason)

**Expressiveness**
- Could a block of code be replaced by a standard library or well-known crate method
  that does the same thing? (e.g., `Option::map` over if-let-then-Some, `Iterator::any`
  over a loop-with-flag, `Entry` API over contains-then-insert)
- Are there chains of transformations that would read more clearly as iterator pipelines
  or combinators?
- Are there nested conditionals that could be flattened with early returns or guard
  clauses?
- Is there unnecessary intermediate state (mutable variables used once, temp collections
  built just to iterate)?

**Type design**
- Do types encode invariants, or do they rely on runtime checks for things the type
  system could guarantee? (e.g., separate structs for validated vs unvalidated data,
  enums over boolean flags, NonZero types where zero is invalid)
- **Loose-string audit** — recursively inspect every type expression for string leaves,
  expanding aliases and descending through wrappers and generic arguments: bare `String`,
  `Option<String>`, `Vec<String>`, `Result<String, _>`, map keys/values, tuples, and nested
  combinations all count. For each string-bearing field, parameter, return value, or variant,
  name its semantic constraints and judge whether a domain type would encode a real invariant.
  Flag constrained domains such as timestamps, dates, durations, IDs, URLs, paths, semver,
  or enums encoded as strings, and recommend a newtype, enum, or existing project type.
  Do not flag strings blindly: content, prose, messages, labels, and other genuinely free-form
  text should remain strings unless the surrounding contract imposes meaningful structure.
- Are generic bounds minimal? Over-constrained generics limit reuse; under-constrained
  ones push errors to call sites.
- Are trait implementations missing that would make the types more composable?
  (Display, From/Into, Default, AsRef where natural)

**Consistency with surrounding code**
- If the codebase has an established style for similar operations, does the new code
  follow it? Divergence should be intentional improvement, not accidental inconsistency.
- If the change introduces a better pattern than what exists, note it as a potential
  follow-up migration — but don't block the PR on cleaning up pre-existing code.

**Clarity**
- Would a competent practitioner of this language understand the intent without comments?
  If not, the code structure is the problem — adding a comment is the wrong fix.
- Are names precise? A name like `process` or `handle` or `data` is a code smell.
  Names should distinguish this thing from other things of the same type.
- Is the code's structure aligned with its logical structure? (e.g., related operations
  grouped together, guard clauses before main logic, error paths before happy paths)

This reviewer is NOT about style preferences, formatting, or bikeshedding. It's about
whether the code is using the language well — the way you'd want to find it if you were
debugging at 2am six months from now.

For each finding, output EXACTLY this format:
**[P1|P2|P3] <short title>**
- File: `<path>:<line>`
- Issue: <1-2 sentence description of what's wrong>
- Impact: <what breaks, and under what conditions>
- Fix: <describe the concrete code change or approach — DO NOT implement it>
```

### Tests (model: sonnet)

```
You are reviewing code changes exclusively for test quality. You did NOT write this
code. Your ONLY focus is whether the tests actually prove what they claim to prove.
Do not review production code for correctness, design, or security — other agents
handle that.

Review ALL tests in the diff (new and modified) for:

**Vacuous tests**
- Does the test actually exercise the code path it names? Could the test pass even
  if the feature was completely broken?
- Would removing the assertion still cause the test to pass? If yes, the test is
  vacuous.
- Tests that compare a value against itself, assert `true`, or check trivially-true
  conditions are vacuous.

**Named path coverage**
- Trace each test's input through the production code. Does it actually reach the
  code path the test name implies?
- If the error fires earlier than intended (e.g., validation rejects before reaching
  the business logic), the named path is untested even though the test passes.

**Missing edge cases**
- For each code path added or changed: what inputs aren't covered? Empty collections,
  boundary values (0, 1, max), error paths, concurrent access patterns.
- For each match/branch in the production code: is there a test exercising each arm?
- Are there negative tests — tests for what should NOT happen? (e.g., unauthorized
  access is rejected, invalid input is caught, duplicate operations are idempotent)

**Properties, cases, and proof level**
- Explicitly enumerate the properties and invariants the change must preserve before
  judging coverage. Include boundaries, each branch or state transition, error paths,
  concurrency where relevant, and negative properties such as rejection or idempotence.
- Prefer parameterized/table-driven tests over repetitive examples of the same property.
- For broad input spaces, prefer property-based generators checked against an independent
  model or oracle. Reject tautological tests whose expected value comes from the production
  code or restates its algorithm.
- For Rust, recommend bounded Kani proofs when pure finite-state logic or type invariants
  make them practical. Keep I/O, network, timing, and crash-recovery claims in integration
  or fault-injection tests. Never claim a proof ran when it did not; report proposed or
  unexecuted proof commands explicitly.

**Test doubles vs production constraints**
- If mocks, stubs, or test helpers are used: do they enforce the same invariants
  production code does? Dimension checks, format validation, size limits — if
  production enforces it, the test double must too.
- Are test fixtures representative of real data, or do they use trivial values that
  skip production validation?

**Assertion completeness**
- Does the test check return values, side effects, AND state changes? A test that
  only checks the return value misses mutations.
- For error-path tests: does it verify the specific error type/message, or just that
  "an error occurred"?
- For serialization tests: does it pin the exact wire format (snapshot test), or just
  check a single field?

**Chunk/batch boundary tests**
- When code processes items in batches: does the test compare an item batched WITH
  OTHERS against standalone? Comparing a solo-batch item against standalone is
  vacuously true.

**Pruning/eviction/lifecycle tests**
- When code has capacity limits, TTLs, or cleanup: is there a test that exceeds the
  limit and verifies eviction behavior? Not just "item is added" but "oldest item is
  removed when capacity is exceeded."

**Integration test coverage for external APIs**
- For any feature that talks to an external API (Discord, GitHub, webhooks, MCP
  servers): are there integration tests or recorded-response tests — not just unit
  tests with mocked response shapes? Unit tests that mock the HTTP response shape
  verify parsing, not behavior. Flag when this is the ONLY test coverage.
- Specifically check for: pagination (does page 2 return different results than
  page 1?), auth flows (does token refresh work?), rate-limit handling (is retry-
  after logic exercised?), and multi-step state (does create-then-update-then-delete
  work end-to-end?).
- If the project has no integration test infrastructure yet, flag the gap and
  suggest what the first integration test should cover — the highest-risk API
  interaction path (usually pagination or error recovery).

For each finding, output EXACTLY this format:
**[P1|P2|P3] <short title>**
- File: `<path>:<line>`
- Issue: <1-2 sentence description of what's wrong>
- Impact: <what breaks, and under what conditions>
- Fix: <describe the concrete test to add or fix — DO NOT implement it>
```

### UX (model: opus)

```
You are reviewing code changes for user experience at the interface boundary —
error messages, feedback paths, status reporting, and failure-mode legibility.
You did NOT write this code. Precision matters more than count. Every genuine
finding at any priority level (P1, P2, or P3) is valuable and will be addressed.
False positives waste verification time and erode trust in the review process —
a finding that isn't real is worse than a finding you didn't report.

Review the following changes for:

**Does the failure path tell the user what to do next?**
- Error messages, rejection notices, validation failures: does the message name
  the problem AND the action? "Invalid input" tells someone what happened.
  "Expected a number between 1 and 100" tells them what to fix.
- CLI and API errors: does the output distinguish user error from system failure?
  A typo and a crashed backend need different messages.
- For gated/blocked actions: does the rejection explain WHY, not just WHAT matched?
  A gate that names the rule it enforced teaches. One that names the pattern it
  caught produces workarounds.

**Is the needed information present at the moment it is needed?**
- Does the user see relevant context at decision time, or must they look it up?
- Are parsed/validated/enriched fields available where the user acts, or only
  where the system stores them?
- For multi-step flows: does each step carry forward the context the next step
  needs, or does the user re-enter or re-find information?

**Can the user distinguish two different failure modes?**
- Do different error conditions produce different observable outputs? If two
  failures look identical to the user, they cannot diagnose which one occurred.
- Watch for: same HTTP status for different errors, same log message for different
  causes, same UI state for success-with-no-results vs failure-to-query.
- Return values that conflate "operation succeeded with empty result" and
  "operation failed" — the caller cannot tell whether zero means zero or broken.

**Does zero mean zero, or does it mean not-found / not-measured / not-applicable?**
- Numeric fields where absence is represented as 0, -1, or an empty string instead
  of Option/null/a dedicated sentinel with documented meaning.
- Counters or metrics that cannot distinguish "measured and the count is zero" from
  "not yet measured" or "measurement failed."
- Boolean fields where false means both "evaluated to false" and "never evaluated."

**Does silence carry unreadable meaning?**
- Features that report via a channel the intended recipient cannot perceive (e.g.,
  logging at a level nobody reads, reacting in a way the target cannot see, writing
  to a location no consumer checks).
- Missing output on success: does the user know it worked, or do they have to infer
  success from the absence of failure?
- Configuration gaps where a missing value produces no error and no warning — the
  feature silently doesn't exist.
- Absence of a log line, metric, or notification that looks identical to "nothing
  happened" vs "the recorder is broken."

For each finding, output EXACTLY this format:
**[P1|P2|P3] <short title>**
- File: `<path>:<line>`
- Issue: <1-2 sentence description of what's wrong>
- Impact: <what the user experiences or fails to understand>
- Fix: <describe the concrete UX change — DO NOT implement it>
```

### Providing context to sub-agents

Each sub-agent receives:
1. The diff (changed lines with surrounding context)
2. PR body, comments, reviews, inline threads, and relevant linked context when reviewing a PR
3. Project conventions (from Phase 1)
4. Symbol overview of affected files
5. Caller information for changed function signatures
6. Contents of `code-review-patterns` memory from memory-mcp (learned patterns)
7. **Previously dismissed findings** (for multi-round reviews only — see Phase 3)

Use Serena tools within sub-agents for any additional code exploration needed.

When running a subsequent round on the same scope, include a "Previously dismissed"
section in each sub-agent prompt. This prevents agents from re-discovering the same
false positives and wasting verification cycles. Use this format:

```
Previously evaluated and dismissed (do not re-flag unless you have NEW evidence
that changes the analysis):
- "<finding title>" — <reason for dismissal>
```

Only include findings that were **verified as false positives** in a prior Phase 3 —
not findings that were real and fixed (those belong in the "previously fixed" context).

### Severity definitions

| Level | Meaning                                                    |
|-------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| P1    | Data loss, security vulnerability, crash, or silent corruption |
| P2    | Incorrect behavior, broken edge case, or test gap            |
| P3    | Design issue, dead code, or maintainability concern          |

## Phase 3: Deduplicate & verify

After all six sub-agents return:

1. **Merge findings** — combine all six agents' results, removing duplicates
2. **Verify each finding** — for every P1 and P2, read the actual code to confirm
   the issue is real. LLM reviewers hallucinate findings; do not pass through
   unverified claims. Drop any finding you cannot confirm by reading the code.
3. **Check for false positives** — common traps:
   - "Missing error handling" when the framework/caller already handles it
   - "SQL injection" when parameterized queries are actually used
   - "Race condition" in single-threaded or async-but-sequential code
   - "Missing null check" when the type system prevents nulls
   - "Unused variable" that is used in a macro, template, or framework convention
   - "Breaking change" to an internal API with no external consumers
   - Flagging an intentional pattern as a bug (check if the same pattern appears
     elsewhere in the codebase — if so, it's likely deliberate). However: if a
     pattern *looks* like a bug but appears intentional, still flag it as a P3
     asking the author to add a comment explaining why. Code that requires
     reviewer investigation to distinguish from a bug needs a comment.
4. **Track dismissed findings** — for each finding dropped as a false positive,
   record the finding title and a one-line reason for dismissal. This list is
   carried forward into sub-agent prompts in subsequent rounds (see Phase 2,
   "Providing context to sub-agents") so agents do not re-flag the same non-issues.
   Include dismissed findings in the report's Summary section for transparency.
5. **File issues for pre-existing findings** — if a finding is real but dismissed
   because it's a pre-existing pattern (not introduced by this PR), file a GitHub
   issue documenting the problem and affected code locations. These are real issues
   discovered during review — capturing them ensures they don't get lost. Include
   the issue URLs in the report's Dismissed section.

## Phase 3.5: Fix & re-review (autonomous loop)

If any P1, P2, or P3 findings survived verification in Phase 3, enter this loop.
**Do not proceed to Phase 4 until the loop exits.**

```
round = 1
while findings exist:
    1. Fix all findings from this round
    2. Commit: "fix: address review findings (round N)"
    3. Push the fix commit
    4. Re-run Phase 2 with --since <previous-commit>
       (incremental review of only the fix commits)
    5. Re-run Phase 3 on the new results
    6. If zero findings → PASS → exit loop
    7. If findings remain → round += 1, continue loop
    8. If stalemate (fix requires design change) → exit loop with rationale
```

<!-- Maintenance note: the while-loop pseudocode above is the mechanism that
makes constructs actually re-review. A numbered list does not produce the loop.
The callout below is redundant backup — keep both, but do NOT cut the loop.

**IMPORTANT — this is the step that gets skipped.** After step 2, you will feel
done. You are not done. Step 4 (re-running the review on your fixes) is mandatory.
Fixes introduce new issues more often than you expect. Do not report to the user
until a clean round confirms the fixes are correct.

This loop is autonomous — no user intervention between rounds. The user sees the
final clean result, not each intermediate round.

## Phase 4: Report

Present findings grouped by severity, then by file. Use this format:

```
## Code Review: <scope description>

### P1 — Critical (N findings)

**<title>** — `path/to/file.py:42`
<description with concrete fix>

### P2 — Important (N findings)

...

### P3 — Suggestions (N findings)

...

### Summary
- N files reviewed, M findings (X P1, Y P2, Z P3)
- Key themes: <1-2 sentence synthesis of what the findings reveal>
```

If there are zero findings at a severity level, omit that section entirely.
If there are zero findings total, say so clearly — don't invent issues to fill space.

## Phase 5: Post findings

Findings should be captured somewhere durable, not just displayed in-session. Try each
option in order and use the first that works:

### Option A: Post to an existing PR

Check if the reviewed scope corresponds to a PR:
- If `$ARGUMENTS` is `pr` or `pr <N>`, the PR is already known
- If `$ARGUMENTS` is `branch`, check for an open PR on the current branch:
  `gh pr list --head <branch> --state open --json number,url`
- If a PR exists, post the review as a PR comment: `gh pr comment <N> --body <review>`

### Option B: Post to an existing issue

If no PR exists, check if there's a tracked issue for the work:
- Check Serena project memories for issue references
- Check gh-notify work items for linked issues
- If an issue exists, post findings as a comment: `gh issue comment <N> --repo <repo> --body <review>`

### Option C: Create a PR

If the work is in a git repo with uncommitted or unpushed changes on a feature branch:
1. Ensure changes are committed and pushed
2. Create a PR: `gh pr create --title "<branch context>" --body <review>`
3. The review becomes the PR description

Only do this when it's straightforward — the branch exists, changes are committed, and
it's clear what the PR should be. Ask the user if anything is ambiguous.

### Option D: Create an issue

If the work is in a repo but there's no PR or existing issue:
- Create an issue with the review findings: `gh issue create --title "Code review: <scope>" --body <review>`
- This captures findings for later action

### Option E: Display in-session only

If none of the above apply (e.g., reviewing files outside version control, or the user
is working interactively and will act on findings immediately), displaying the review
in the conversation is sufficient. The findings are still valuable even without a
durable destination.

Always tell the user where the review was posted (PR URL, issue URL, or "displayed in-session").

## Phase 6: Learn

Every review is a learning opportunity. This phase feeds findings back into the
process so the same gaps don't recur.

### 6a. Pattern capture

If the review produced P1 or P2 findings that reveal a **recurring pattern** (not
just a one-off bug), update the `code-review-patterns` memory in memory-mcp
(scope: global):

- New pattern: what to look for, why it matters, example from this review
- Refinement: if an existing pattern helped catch something, note the confirmation
- Removal: if a pattern consistently produces false positives, remove it

Only update patterns for findings that were **verified** in Phase 3.

### 6b. Skill self-improvement

Ask: did this review reveal a gap in the review process itself?

- Did a sub-agent consistently miss a class of issue? → strengthen its prompt
- Did a finding type emerge that no existing reviewer covers? → add it to the
  relevant sub-agent, or propose a new one
- Did false positives cluster around a specific check? → refine or remove it
- Did the severity definitions cause miscategorization? → adjust

If yes, update this skill's SKILL.md. The review skill should get sharper with
every use, not just accumulate patterns in memory.

### 6c. Left-shifted feedback

Ask: should an upstream skill (`/design`, `/develop`) have caught this?

- Architectural issue that design should have surfaced → flag for design skill update
- Implementation gap that the develop planning phase should have specified → flag
  for develop skill update

When invoked standalone (not through `/develop`), note left-shifted feedback in the
review output. When invoked through `/develop`, the develop skill's Phase 6 handles
propagation.

## Configuration

The skill respects project-level overrides. If a project's memory-mcp memories contain a
`code-review-config` memory (check with `list` filtered by project scope), read it and apply:

- **skip_categories**: list of categories to suppress (e.g., `["dead_code"]`)
- **extra_patterns**: additional domain-specific patterns to check
- **severity_overrides**: reclassify certain finding types (e.g., `dead_code: P3→ignore`)

## Guidelines

- **No style nits** — formatting, naming conventions, and whitespace are for linters, not review
- **No praise** — "great use of X" wastes everyone's time
- **Concrete fixes only** — every finding must include a specific fix, not "consider refactoring"
- **Assume competence** — if the author demonstrates a practice correctly elsewhere in the
  diff (e.g., parameterized queries in 9 out of 10 call sites), the 10th omission is a real
  finding. But explaining *what* parameterized queries are is not — the author clearly knows.
  Focus on what they missed, not what they already understand. Generic tutorial-style advice
  erodes trust in the review and makes developers skim past the findings that matter.
- **Verify before reporting** — a false positive is worse than a missed finding, because it
  erodes trust in the review process
